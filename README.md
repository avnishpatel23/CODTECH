Here's an overview of a project to-do list built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- CSS: Styles the application to make it visually appealing. This includes the layout, fonts, colors, and the appearance of tasks (like striking through completed tasks).

- JavaScript: Handles the functionality of the to-do list. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The JavaScript code dynamically updates the list as users interact with the application.
